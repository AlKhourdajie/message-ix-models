# In the source scenario:
# - data are for technologies like ``coal_trp``.
# - there were no data for eth_{if}c_trp.
# - data were identical to
#   ixmp://cloned-2021-06-09/MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM_R12_CHN/baseline
# - units were recorded as "kg / kWa". This appears to be incorrect:
#   https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php gives CO₂
#   intensity of natural gas as 52.91 kg / 10⁶ BTU; this is 1582 kg / kW·a or
#   431 kg / kW·a carbon equivalent.

# Unit: kg / kWa
