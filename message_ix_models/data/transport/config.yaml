# Default configuration file for MESSAGEix-Transport
#
# TODO move the following description to the documentation
#
# This file contains the default values for configuration keys that:
#
# - are not specific to a node (region) codelist, i.e. those without a 'node' or
#   similar dimension.
# - are not set programmatically in .model.transport.configure.
#
# Other keys that *are* specific to a node codelist include:
#
# - node to census region
# - share weight convergence
