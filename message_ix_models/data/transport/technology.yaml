    In MESSAGE-V, the output of all freight technologies was labelled: f-u

    FR_FCg, FR_FCm]
  units: Gv km

AIR:
  name: Aviation
  report: "Domestic Aviation"
  description: >-
    Aviation (passenger aircraft only, ignoring shared freight component).

    The aviation technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
    vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
    that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
    See [1]. The occupancy factor assumed for all aviation technologies is 115.

    In MESSAGE-V, the output of these technologies was labelled: a-u
  child: [con_ar, conh_ar, conm_ar, conE_ar]
  units: Gv km

BUS:
  name: Urban public transit
  description: >-
    Buses and other forms of urban public transit.

    The bus technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
    vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
    that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
    See [1]. The occupancy factor assumed for all urban public transit bus
    technologies is 20.9.

    In MESSAGE-V, the output of these technologies was labelled: u-u
  child: [ICE_H_bus, ICE_M_bus, ICG_bus, ICAe_bus, ICH_bus, FC_bus, FCg_bus,
         FCm_bus, Trolley_bus, PHEV_bus]
  units: Gv km

RAIL:
  name: Passenger rail
  description: >-
    Rail; passenger trains only, both urban public transit and long-distance
    intercity.

    The rail technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
    vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
    that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
    See [1]. crail_pub and drail_pub have no capacity in MESSAGE and only
    exist for bookkeeping purposes.

    In MESSAGE-V, the output of these technologies was labelled: i-u
  child: [crail_pub, dMspeed_rai, drail_pub, Hspeed_rai, Mspeed_rai, rail_pub]
  units: Gv km
