  AIR:
    description: >
      Aviation (passenger aircraft only, ignoring shared freight component).

      The aviation technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
      vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
      that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
      See [1]. The occupancy factor assumed for all aviation
      technologies is 115.

  BUS:
    description: >
      Buses (urban public transit)

      The bus technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
      vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
      that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
      See [1]. The occupancy factor assumed for all urban public transit bus
      technologies is 20.9.

  RAIL:

      Rail (passenger trains only, both urban public transit and long-distance
      intercity)

      The rail technologies in MESSAGE directly output passenger-km, not
      vehicle-km; therefore, we must make use of the same occupancy factors here
      that were used to define the aviation technologies in the first place.
      See [1]. crail_pub and drail_pub have no capacity in MESSAGE and only
      exist for bookkeeping purposes.
