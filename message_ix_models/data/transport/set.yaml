# Set configuration for the MESSAGE-Transport model

# For each set in the MESSAGEix framework, the group contains:
# - 'require': elements that must be present for the model to be set up.
# - 'remove': elements to remove.
# - 'add': elements to add. This is a mapping from element short names to a
#   longer description.
